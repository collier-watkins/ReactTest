# ReactTest
This repo is a history of learning React.

Following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0). Last stopped at 32:50.

## Setup Instructions
Install Node.js and run the command `sudo npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2`.

Navigate to your project folder. Run `create-react-app react-test`.

A new directory will be created named `react-test`. Inside that directory, the following commands may be run:
```shell
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-test
  npm start
```
Installed Bootstrap, a CSS library for modern look and feel. `npm install bootstrap@4.1.1`. Install any dependencies needed as well.
