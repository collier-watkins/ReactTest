# ReactTest
Testing ReactJS components for a future project

## Setup Instructions
Install Node.js and run the command `sudo npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2`.

Navigate to your project folder. Run `create-react-app react-test`.

A new directory will be created named `react-test`. Inside that directory, the following commands may be run:
```shell
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-test
  npm start
```
